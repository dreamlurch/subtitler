# Subtitler (powered by OpenAI Whisper)

This project loads audio/video into the browser, generates subtitles and lines up those subtitles with the loaded media.  

It requires running a backend locally as well, which can be setup by visiting [Subtitler-Backend](https://github.com/jojeyh/subtitler-backend.git) and following the instructions.

To get started, 

```
git clone https://github.com/jojeyh/subtitler.git
cd subtitler
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your favorite browser and navigate to the url displayed by the vite server.

Enjoy!
